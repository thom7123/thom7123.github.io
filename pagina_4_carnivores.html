The only dinosaurs he can live with are the large herbivores. The T-Rex can be unlocked by traveling to Isla Tacano. When you arive at Isla Tacano you need to build an expidition center and you can do expeditions to locations that have the T-Rex. When the genome is at 50% you can make him.</td>

To unlock him in game you have to be on Isla Pena and you need the Velociraptor and the T-Rex to be a complete genome (100%) and you need to do a 2 milion dollar research task until you can make him. The nice thing about the Indominus is that he has a high rating and is instantly at 100% genome which means without genetic upgrades he can not fail.</td>
